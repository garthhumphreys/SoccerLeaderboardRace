### What is a 'Bar Chart Race'
Bar chart races have been around for a while. This year, they took social media by storm. It began with Matt Navarraâ€™s tweet, which was viewed 10 million times. Then, John Burn-Murdoch created reproducible notebook using d3.js, others started creating their races. Then, Flourish studio released [race chart](https://flourish.studio/2019/03/21/bar-chart-race/) for non-programmers. Since then hundreds of races have been shared on the Internet.
